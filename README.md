One of my first side projects since getting my knowledge base solidified when it comes to programming. Really, I just want a place to document my progress with this simple game and also have a place to store stable source code if my attempted changes break the game haha! 

This repo also serves as a means to familiarize myself with git as a concept, git commands, and how to implement it into my workflow.
